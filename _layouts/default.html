## miles biked: 6.9
## brain dump
I met Char & Denise at Scout Cafe's holiday market. the coffee shop was bustling with locals eager to peruse crafts and get their shopping done. I was so amazed at the turnout & community atmostphere and especially charmed by the calm orchestration of owner Nick through it all. as Denise pointed out, his killer overalls told all. I felt so grateful to get the opportunity to connect more with Char and to meet Denise on a deeper level as I'd only interacted with her briefly at Chomsky Day the Friday prior. she brings such a joyful, perceptive, & sharp-witted energy to a conversation, and I look forward to our future hangs involving soup. 
## today's list: winter get togethers
- cookies & cards - make sweet treats & write sweet words (family, friends, legislators)
- soup swap - enjoy a sampling of cozy broths of joy
- nostalgia watch - replay our fave shows or movies from childhood, popcorn mandatory
- brunch & goals - munch & talk about our aspirations for the coming quarter }}
