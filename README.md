# brain dump: 7 December 2025
a list of winter get togethers:
- cookies & cards - make sweet treats & write sweet words (family, friends, legislators)
- soup swap - enjoy a sampling of cozy broths of joy
- nostalgia watch - replay our fave shows or movies from childhood, popcorn mandatory
- brunch & goals - munch & talk about our aspirations for the coming quarter
