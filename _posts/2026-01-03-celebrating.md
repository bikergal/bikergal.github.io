## miles biked: 0
## brain dump:
it's really special getting to interact with a group of folks who have been together for a long time. 
siblings celebrating 60th, 70th birthdays. friends going strong since middle school. artists who draw together for nearly 1000 weeks straight.
I feel inspired by this kind of commitment. there's no marriage certificate, no legal reprecussions of neglect.
the relationship keeps going from both sides saying yes (with some nos sprinkled in, sure) consistently.

you see just a snapshot of their history, shared memories, and mannerisms. it feels like watching a movie.

## today's list: haunted house stories on the Cape
- a washing machine turning on whenever someone left the basement
- a chair moving across an empty attic
- floor plans floating up in the air
