## miles biked: 7.8
## brain dump
I'm an oxymoron today, driving the gym to bike instead of biking to the gym. in my defense, it was 5:50 am, and the class starts at 6:00 am. surprisingly, I didn't hate my first cycling class, and I think it's one of the few times I actually pushed myself while biking despite 5k+ miles on tour. 

we had 2 new people come to the house today, one cat sitter to meet Tahini & Tabasco and one contractor to give us an estimate for a patio. it felt a little out of body when they were here; I realized I had categorized hiring help and doing home renovations to things only a wealthy American family would do. to be fair, we live comfortably and don't have kids which helps expenses immensely.

despite only sleeping from 12:30 to 5:30 am, I'm surprisingly alert, running on one cup of black tea. I'm sure it'll just hit me tomorrow instead. maybe this is the week to try out my staying up skills and go dancing. they just don't make dancing events for people on a grandma schedule; everything starts at 9 or 10 pm, my usual bedtime. I'm long overdue at the Dolphin Tavern.
