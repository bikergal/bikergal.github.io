## brain dump
another overwork underbike day. I at least had some real social interactions at work that weren't just a bunch of people dumping more tasks on me, so I'll take that as a win.

for the past few weeks, we've been corresponding with Maine Bike Works to build our dream rides. no dentist bikes here, just pure touring utility. it's starting to feel a little more real.

I hashed out a lot of thoughts on the work side with my mentor Ron, a very sweet engineer in his 50s who empathizes with my self-induced pain points. he's been great to talk to amidst all the rapid changes in our company.

on the non-work side, I just know I'll feel like I'm missing out on life here. I started to mention at Chomsky Day that I felt sad this would be our last in-person attendance for a while, and Pragmatic Dave reminded me not to be pre-sad about something so far away.
he's right. yet Camille who is still 12 and writing emo songs wants to tell him he's wrong while strumming a guitar dramatically.
