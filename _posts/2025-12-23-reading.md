Hunt, Gather, Parent has new inspired and makes child rearing feel just a little more in reach. 
I'm really appreciating learning about Intuit traditions of development and cultural values. 

A key tenant of teaching is to keep your emotions in check which feels the total opposite of what I've been trying to do lately. 
I grew up shy, so I've been working on being more expressive, but learning more about the importance of giving energy selectively gives me better focus. 

for example, there's no need to scream when a child runs to the edge of the ice. what's more effective is getting there to support and using a form neutral tone to provide information. 
the whole goal is to get the child to think for themselves in the moment and keep them safe. the actual teaching takes place in an entirely different and calmed down environment when the child will be more receptive (and the parent will be less worked up).

this book even has me considering multiple kids which I've never really considered before. 
next up are the lessons from Tanzania. stay tuned.
