## brain dump
parenting books have always been appealing to my anxiety. Hunt, Gather, Parent feels especially healing as it essentially details how to cultivate a successful member of a collectivist family. 
I can see how my parents attempted to bring me up this way but didn't follow the full script. it feels empowering to know that there's another way. 
reading this book at my in-laws' feels particularly timely as I'm always wondering how Feez & I grew up differently. 

## today's list: some activities I was drawn to as a child but wasn't allowed to do
- helping fix plumbing
- helping fix cars
- lacrosse
- lifting heavy things 
- being friends with boys
