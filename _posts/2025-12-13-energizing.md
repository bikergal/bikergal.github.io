## brain dump 
sunrise yoga was a welcome return at 6:30 am. I had the best intentions to bike there, but writing this at 11 pm, I'm certainly not mad I drove ahead of an action-packed day. 

we hosted sichuan & goals, and when I got home, there was still much to be done. I went into video game mode for a few hours, and by the grace of a great partner, we managed to finish all our dishes, even if they didn't all turn out exactly as we'd hoped. it was a true treat hearing about everyone's aspirations for the next quarter & year. I feel so lucky to be part of this process & that folks are always so willing to share. throughout the next couple months, I want to make a point to check in with some of the things people mentioned today.

the evening brought us to a white Longwood Christmas. snow came down in a soft drizzle as Feez, Erika, & I explored the carefully manicured Winter Wonderland. I had one of those dissociative moments where it felt like I was watching myself from a bird's eye view. I thought about how my ancestors & my storyline brought me here today to be able to walk around a huge garden on my leisure time. it's pretty humbling for me; these thoughts also come up for me when mountain biking. 

# today's list: things I overthought
- is it going to be way cold tonight at Longwood?
- do I really need a new jacket?
- how bad is polyester, really?
- how much food should we make, should I nix this dish
- if I don't keep the conversation going, people might think I don't want them here, so I better kdep talking.
