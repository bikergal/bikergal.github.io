## miles biked: 1.9
## brain dump
Trevor Noah recently had comedian Joe Opio on the podcast. Joe's philosophy is to not sweat the small stuff because he's "winning life". 

a hackneyed way to put it, but it's a lesson that'll be sticking with me hopefully for a while. Joe is famously never upset and doesn't let disappointments get him down. he's incredibly understanding, patient, and joyful. 

I find myself wondering what it would take for me to embrace this kind of radical gratitude. and I think all I have to do is listen to myself (not just my fears) and practice. I think I can work on that.

## today's list: what usually prevents me from taking action
- I'm worried about social rejection
- I feel like I don't belong
- I'm afraid of showing what I really want
