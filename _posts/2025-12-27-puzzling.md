## brain dump

I do the NY Times crossword almost every day. 
it's been great for getting my mind off ruminations, practicing long attention, and just doing something fun for me. 

often I'll come across a clue and find myself stuck. I notice that I'm quick to think, oh I must not know this word. 
sometimes that is in fact the case. other times, it's because I kept bashing my head against one singular interpretation.
I realized today that I have more success getting unstuck when I completely abandon my inital idea and just try out another idea.
this takes some activation energy though since my default is to be stubborn... 
I'm looking forward to testing out this theory more in puzzling as well as in other scenarios.
