winter snoozies are getting me. it doesn't help that my sleep schedule is all over the place. 

I've been practicing not taking personal ownership of problems at work. contemplating EMT life has me reconsidering what I want to stress myself out on.

I can confidently say that I've never run into a life or death situation at work. sure, the work I do can help prevent accidents, but changing the color on a powerbi report isn't going to save anyone's life.

I'm still grateful for the life my job affords me, can't deny that. I just switched my 401k contributions from max to 5%. it feels a little scary not putting more away, but I know I'll be fine.

## today's list: fabrics I like
