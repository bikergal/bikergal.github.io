## brain dump
genealogy is an area I have long admired and envied about Feez's family. they can trace at least 10 generations back to their ancestors by name and history.
this is not without effort; his mom put a lot of effort into building this compilation. the result is a gift of a lifetime for even more generations to come. 

I've long been interested in documenting my own family's history. I'll be happy with whatever I can get, fully expecting some gaps or Spanish erasure.
my parents never really gave out stories willingly the way I see these families dive into details about the past. 
I feel nervous asking my parents and extended family for more details. I think I want to prioritize it though.
