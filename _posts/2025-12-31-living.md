## miles biked: 0
## brain dump
in a journal from around 2020, I remember writing about what my perfect day would look like.
I would spend time in nature, move my body, and hang out & play board games with friends.
I gotta say today was pretty close.

knowing this space is waiting for me each day to put my thoughts down has been so refreshing.
I'm noticing how much I appreciate my life just recognizing what happens throughout the day.
it's as if mindfulness was the key all along.

## today's list: board games we found a new home for
- Santorini
- Cat in the Box
- Hanabi
- 7 Wonders Duel
- Carcassonne
- Galaxy Truckers
