## miles biked: 1.2
## brain dump
my tenancy is to keep moving. I go go go and then look to the next thing. 
when I visit my in-law's, I'm reminded that slowing down is allowed. 
I watched tv for over 4 hours today, and while that's not necessarily inherently good, I noticed that I didn't feel as guilty as I usually do. 
I value sharing content with people, plus I got to catch up on fiber crafts.

## today's list: storytellings I overthought today
- Sylvia's visit on New Year's Eve
- some other thing from years ago that I don't even remember now
- Feez asking for baklava after saying he didnt want any
