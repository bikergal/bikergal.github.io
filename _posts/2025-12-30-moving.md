## miles biked: 0
## brain dump
if you've never listened to Snoop Dogg's "I wanna thank me" acceptance speech, it's honestly an inspiring mantra.

"Last but not least, I wanna thank me
I wanna thank me for believing in me
I wanna thank me for doing all this hard work
I wanna thank me for having no days off
I wanna thank me for never quitting
I wanna thank me for always being a giver
And tryna give more than I receive
I wanna thank me for tryna do more right than wrong
I wanna thank me for just being me at all times
Snoop Dogg, you a bad motherfucker"

I probably would've wrote it off as vain & conceited when I was younger (& more judgey).
when I hear these words now, I really feel the weight behind all the effort & how valuable that self-love really is.


## today's list: some rules I have for myself
- can't throw away plastic bags or containers unless they are completely full (of trash)
- must walk or bike if 1 mile away
- must bike if under 3 miles away
- don't eat meat unless it's a very special exception (celebraterian)
- must blow nose into handkerchiefs
- don't own too many things
