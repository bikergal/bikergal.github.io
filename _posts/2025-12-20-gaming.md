## brain dump
joy is a hard thing to measure and even harder to appraise.

how much enjoyment do I receive from one soup dumpling? how about 2? what about a soup dumpling at home versus in a restaurant? and with company versus myself?

what price equates to the amount of enjoyment I'm receiving? it'd be pretty easy to get crazy and caught up in the economics of all those decisions.
I don't know if it's this way for most other people, but I get the sense that I'd be doing more if I stopped to calculate what value time or money invested gives me.
my default is to save save save. but that ain't living.
