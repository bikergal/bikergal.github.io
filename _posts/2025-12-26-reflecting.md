## brain dump
I used to think scarcity mindset was just about financial stress. 
lately I've been looking up words and concepts I don't 100% know, and it turns out I have lots to learn.

my anxiety around lack of resources extends far beyond just money. 
I grew up training myself to suppress wants, save money, and building a narrative of unworthiness.

I didn't deserve to have new things; I didn't need them. I didn't need to take up space in the world or in a conversation.
it would be selfish if I wanted things & got them for myself instead of doing something that would benefit other people.

obviously, going the other way isn't great either. the trick is just finding the balance.

## today's list: strategies for addressing a scarcity mindset
- catch yourself when you notice an all-or-nothing thought
- gratitude
- work on small attainable goals (a daily entry on this blog is one of them for me)
- commune with people with an abundance mindset
