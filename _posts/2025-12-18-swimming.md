## miles biked: 10
## brain dump
it's empowering biking to work. I always ask myself, why don't I bike more often whenever I do it. let's qualify though, *whenever I do it in good weather*.
my fan boy at the office (a middle-aged man who is star-struck by my ability to bike up the Alapocas hill) is really sweet about complimenting me.
we're both very awkward, and it's kind of nice in a way to remember that not everyone has everything figured out. 
I nod as he tells me the same story for the 4th time this year. I chime in a couple times in anticipation of a detail to signal that I was listening the first 3 times.
either he doesn't hear me or just prefers to tell the whole story anyway. some people are just like that.
I wonder if he would actually show up if we invited him to our retirement party. I really do embrace The More the Merrier, but I know sometimes that's just an ideal.
