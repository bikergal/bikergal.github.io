## brain dump
it was a couch-potato too-much-work kind of day. I sadly did not make it to the gym and clocked 12 hours of company time. these are usually the worst days, but it felt a little more manageable today. maybe those vitamin D gummies are working after all.

I worked at the office 40-min's drive away today (so no bike commuting), and I also convince myself it's ok to skip the gym today because I'm still a little sore from yesterday's BODYPUMP class. I resent that I care so much about doing such a good job at work.

tomorrow our group? section? is hosting a potluck. I signed up for the cheapest & easiest thing I could think of to make, arroz con leche. I was pretty happy to use up the tiramisu containers I saved from a few months ago to serve the rice pudding in. 
don't get me wrong, I still adore cooking. while stirring the grains on the stove, I was recalling my friend Paul asking what I liked about cooking vs. baking. to me. cooking feels like a game: what can I make with the resources I currently have? baking is more like an art session; I'm in the mood to create something pretty. I suppose I have a third category now: soulless corporate potluck. pure utility.
