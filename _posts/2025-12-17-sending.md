I gotta figure these allergies out. I unfortunately am developing reactions to Tahini. hello from Snothead this evening.

last night was the first Bake Night in probably over a decade. in grade school, I used to sign myself up for a night of concocting many treats, usually coinciding with the day before winter finals. 

I would stay up until the wee hours of the night, procrastinating study and making brownies, cookies, and cakes for friends (and acquaintenances) at school.

Bake Night was loathed by all other members of the Mapua household. I would bang and clang around the kitchen in Crazy Mode TM. it was a chaos storm, and everyone would keep their distance.

it always felt so important to me to pass out goodies to my classmates around Christmastime. some people didn't really appreciate it the way I'd hoped. others were really touched by it. that kept me going.

I think that still keeps me going now. I'm practicing gratitude for this kind of feedback *without* reliance.

## today's list: people in line at the post office
- a woman sending 5 giant pop-up Christmas cards (at least 8.5 x 11")
- a man concerned about the level of packages in the drop off bin
- a man buying 500 stamps
- a woman transferring an address from her phone contacts to a letter
