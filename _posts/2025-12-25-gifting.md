## brain dump
a rewatch of Avatar and ambivalence about an American Christmas makes me wonder more about the possibility of cultivating a collectivist culture in place.
it just seems incompatible without going to an austere extreme like the Amish. I find myself curious about the rural Vermont communities I read online articles about.

I value shared goals as well as autonomy, and I'm so drawn to the allure of interconnectedness. the promise of Belonging. creating that all on my own hasn't been going so well.
it really does take a village, and I'm no founder, but I'm still a committed member, contributing whenever I find myself with motivation. I just don't want that contingency anymore.
