## miles biked: 1.2
## brain dump
scarcity mindset says I don't have enough time to take care of all that needs to be done before our trip. 
I know that's not necessarily true, but the urgency still manifests itself. 
I haven't decided yet if the item tracking is helpful or enabling. 
I think it's overall beneficial to see my progress so far.

it's funny when a friend tells you good news because you want to strike that balance of excitement and support but not make it about anything else really negative.
at least I don't. I could maybe squeal more and then maybe that's taking too much of the stage if the friend is real chill. 
or if I pry more and we're not that close, is that just taking an opportunity to connect or is it more stress-inducing. 

probably just the anxiety talking.
