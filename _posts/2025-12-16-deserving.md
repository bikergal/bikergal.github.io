## miles biked: 2.6
## brain dump
therapy can be hit or miss. I've been to providers that I didn't feel like I was getting a lot of insight with, and I've been with others who have been truly life-changing. 

Melissa is in the latter category, and I'm grateful this corporate job actually covers her sessions. we're having good discussions about what desert means and my pre-decision internal dialogue.

a common morning inner conflict goes like this: it's getting late, I need to get to work. should I drive? no, I don't need to waste gas, that's just bad for the air and a waste of money. plus, biking is better because that would be most environmentally positive and healthiest. do I actually feel like biking though? it's stressful in the mornings with drivers not always giving me as much space as I'd like. well, I can handle it. do I want to deal with that this morning though? what if I took the bus instead? that would still be eco-friendly. what time does the bus come? shoot, 10 minutes and I still need to eat and brush. well, I probably still have time to bike. maybe I don't want to have to rush today though. no, I can make myself hustle; it's really not that hard to get it all done in 10 minutes. I could just skip eating; maybe I'll just come home at lunch. or I could get that really tasty falafel from the food cart nearby. no, I should be saving money. plus it's not the healthiest anyway. it's so yummy though, when's the last time I got it, a few months ago? shoot, only 5 minutes till the bus comes. now I definitely don't have time to bike. do I have everything? wait, gotta get my water bottle; there's no way I can waste a disposable cup when it'll take me 10 seconds to grab this bottle. ok, shoes on bag on let's go. maybe we need to start sprinting. alright, almost there. 

sometimes the bus passes right by me. then I drag my feet back to the house and bloody drive anyway.
