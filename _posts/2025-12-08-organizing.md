## miles biked: 1.4
## brain dump
it feels difficult to let little typos go. once something's written down, it feels permanent and final. I'm practicing low-risk creation, like this blog. I'll put this out into the ether, and if it's not perfect, the world will still keep turning.

I went to ACME to pick up a few things, timing it with the expiration of my free donut coupon. mind you, donuts at this grocery store are $1.39 and pretty mid-tier but nonetheless satisfying for this fiend. my parents are to blame; they ran a donut shop when my mother was pregnant with me, so I was clearly born to eat these tasty treats. ACME has the donuts displayed in a case, and normal shoppers will use the designated plastic tissue and place their treat in a big box also provided nearby. I despise the waste and scold myself on the bike ride over for not bringing a tupperware to put it in. I resolve to just use the plastic tissue and skip the box as a compromise. I pick out a vanilla-frosted yeasty boy, and then I start to worry about whether the employees will think I'm stealing if I go to self-checkout. so I get in the very long line at the cashier's, even rejecting someone who asks if I'd like to jump ahead of them in the self-checkout. after a few more minutes of waiting, I go to self-checkout anyway. 

the blue flimsy plastic barely covers the surface area of the donut, and I'm trying hard not to squish him all while juggling my helmet, bike bag, and grocery bag of almond milk & 4 packs of salad (more plastic!). I'm also wearing enormous gloves, diminishing my dexterity even more. I get my bike lock off one-handed, and start riding home while eating my hard-earned treat. there are a few drops, but I know where to be careful and amazingly make it home just in time to finish my evidence as I pull into the driveway. Feez will never know just how bad I was today.
